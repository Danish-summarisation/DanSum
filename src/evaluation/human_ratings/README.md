<b>Evaluation of Human Ratings</b>

This folder contains the analysis of the human ratings of 100 randomly chosen articles including reference summary and three generated summaries by the DanSumT5 models.

The code eval_human_ratings.py is the script used to format the ratings and to calculate the interrater agreement between the raters. 
Two csv files containing the data are found in the data folder outside the src folder. These include the ratings from each rater where number 1 denotes the highest rated summary and so on.
