## About The Project

This repository contains the code for creating an automatic abstractive summarisation tool in Danish. We fine-tuned a language-specific pruned mT5 model on an abstractive subset of the DaNewsroom dataset.

The model can be used for summarisation of individual news articles using [this notebook](https://github.com/idabh/data-science-exam/blob/main/generate_summary.ipynb), or through the [huggingface API](https://huggingface.co/sarakolding/daT5-summariser).

### Abstract
Automatic abstractive text summarisation is a challenging task in the field of natural language processing. This paper aims to further develop and refine previous work by the authors in domain-specific automatic summarisation for Danish news articles. We extend that work by cleaning the data, pruning the vocabulary of a multilingual model, and improving the parameter tuning and model selection, as well as evaluating results using additional metrics.
We fine-tune a pruned mT5 model on a cleaned subset of the DaNewsroom dataset consisting of abstractive summary-article pairs. The resulting model is evaluated quantitatively using ROUGE, BERTScore and density measures, and qualitatively by comparing the generated summaries to our previous work. We find that though model refinements increase quantitative and qualitative performance, the model is prone to hallucinations, and the resulting ROUGE scores are in the lower range of comparable abstractive summarisation efforts in other languages. A discussion of the limitations of the current evaluation methods for automatic abstractive summarisation underline the need for improved metrics and transparency within the field. Future work could employ methods for detecting and reducing hallucinations in model output, and employ methods for reference-less evaluation of summaries. <br>

### Model performance
These are the quantitative results (mean F1 scores) of our model-generated summaries:

| Metric  | Result |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **BERTScore**  | 71.41  |
| **ROUGE-1**  | 23.10 |
| **ROUGE-2**   | 7.53  |
| **ROUGE-L**   | 18.52 |
